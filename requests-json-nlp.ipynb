    "# Question 4\n",
    "4. Write a function that takes the name of a file that contains song lyrics, loads the file, performs sentiment analysis, and returns the polarity score.  Use this function to print the polarity scores (with the name of the song) of the three files you created in question 3.  Does the reported polarity match your understanding of the song's lyrics? Why or why not do you think that might be?  Answer the questions in either a comment in the code cell or a markdown cell under the code cell."

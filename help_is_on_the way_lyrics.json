Right here!\nRight here! Right here!\nRight here! Right here!\n\nChoking on the black gold,\nUpon which we rely,\n\nWe keep axes in the attics,\nTo see cameras in the sky.\n\nHelp is on the way\n(They said, they said)\nHelp is on the way\n(They said, they said)\n\nWe were told just to sit tight,\n'Cause somebody will soon arrive.\nHelp is on the way.\nBut it never came!\nIt never came!\n\nHelp is on the way\n(They said, they said)\nHelp is on the way\n(They said, they said)\n\nOne by land, two by sea.\nRight there in front of me.\nHelp is on the way.\nOn the way."

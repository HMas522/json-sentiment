Here we go!\n\nWelcome to the shitshow\n\nGrab a comfortable seat\nFind me in the front row\nListening to music\nAnyone can see\n\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\n(She works out too much and)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much and)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out enough\n(He's trying)\n\nRemember to drink a glass of water before and after you work out\n\n[?] form and shape\nStick with it\nHere we go!\n\nI'm going off the deep end\nTime to let myself go\nNothing's ever as easy as when\nIt never begins\nThe end is just a dream\n\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\n(She works out too much and...)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\n(She works out too much and...)\n\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out enough\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\n(She works out too much and...)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\n(She works out too much and...)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nHe didn't work out enough\n(He's trying)\n(She works out too much)\nThe only reason we never worked out was\nWe didn't work out, it never works out\nNo, it never works out\nShe works out too much\n\nNo, I never work out\nIt didn't work out\nNo, it never works out\n\nOkay, we're done"

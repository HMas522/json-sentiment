    "lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Nine in the afternoon par Panic! At The Disco\r\nBack to the street where we began\nFeeling as good as lovers can .. you know\nYeah, we're feeling so good\n\nPicking up things we shouldn't read\nIt looks like the end of history as we know\nIt's just the end of the world\n\nBack to the street where we began\nFeeling as good as love .. you could .. you can\n\nInto a place, where thoughts can bloom\nInto a room where it's nine in the afternoon\nAnd we know that it could be\nAnd we know that it should\nAnd you know that you feel it too\n\n'Cause it's nine in the afternoon\n\nAnd your eyes are the size of the moon\nYou could 'cause you can so you do\nWe're feeling so good\njust the way that we do\nWhen it's nine in the afternoon\n\nYour eyes are the size of the moon\nYou could 'cause you can so you do\nWe're feeling so good\n\nBack to the street\nDown to our feet\nLosing the feeling of feeling unique\nDo you know what I mean?\n\nBack to the place\n\nWhere we used to say\nMan it feels good to feel this way\nNow I know what I mean\n\nBack to the street, back to the place,\nBack to the room where it all began\nBack to the room where it all began\n'Cause it's nine in the afternoon\n\nYour eyes are the size of the moon\nYou could 'cause you can so you do\nWe're feeling so good\nJust the way that we do\nWhen it's nine in the afternoon"
